We got a couple of errors that we wasted a lot of time figuring out.  Just for the record:

`waiting for OTA Service...` repeated about 10 times, then failing.  This happened after we re-imaged the cRIO.  You need to restart the cRIO.

`java.net.AddressBindException` when trying to run code from within NetBeans.  This was an error on the laptop, not the cRIO.  No clue why, and no ports were open as
far as we could tell.  But rebooting the laptop made it go away.
